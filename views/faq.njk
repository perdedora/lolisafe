        <strong>Full-length episodes of cartoons, TV shows or movies of any kind.</strong> Japanese, Chinese, Antarcticaness, I don't care.<br>
        CD drama audio files. I only know of Japanese shows that have these, but regardless of nationality.<br>
        <br>
        Any of such uploads, when found, will be purged immediately without any prior notice.<br>
        Repeat offenders will have their IPs permanently blocked from accessing {{ globals.whole_faq }}.<br>
        For child pornography specifically, first offenders will immediately be blocked permanently.<br>
        <br>
        * When Google Safe Search detects <i>unwanted software</i>, Chrome's users will be alerted that anything they download from {{ globals.whole_faq }} are <i>unsafe</i>.

        We do have some browser extensions to assist uploads:<br>
        <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lolisafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox extension</a>. Maintained by me. Its GitHub repository is located <a href="https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/loli-safe-extension" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br>
        <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loli-safe-uploader/enkkmplljfjppcdaancckgilmgoiofnj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome extension</a>. Maintained by lolisafe's team. Its GitHub repository is located <a href="https://github.com/WeebDev/loli-safe-extension" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br>
        With the Chrome extension specifically, you will have to manually set the domain in the extension's settings to <code>https://safe.fiery.me</code>.<br>
        <br>
        If you use Windows desktop, the safe support uploads from <a href="https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShareX</a>.<br>
        You can download the config file by clicking on the ShareX icon on the homepage.<br>
        When logged in, the config file will also be automatically populated with your account's token.<br>
        This will allow you to manage your ShareX uploads from our Dashboard.<br>
        <br>
        If you use Linux desktop, there is a compatible bash uploader which I also maintain.<br>
        You can learn more about it from <a href="https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/uguush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its GitHub repository</a>.

        This site is using Cloudflare, which limits the maximum upload size.<br>
        Since the homepage uploader chunks your uploads through JS wizardry, it is possible to increase the maximum file size there.

      <div class="message-body">
        <strong>Yes.</strong> The homepage uploader was coded to chunk uploads into {{ chunkSizeInt }} MB pieces by default. However, this is configurable through its Config tab.<br>
        <br>
        If you want to chunk your API uploads, feel free to inspect the source code to see how it works.<br>
        A rough description of how it works is to simply upload the chunks with their UUID information attached,<br>
        and then call the "finish chunks" API with the said UUID, to rebuild them into a single proper file.

        Logs are rotated daily, and the server will only keep the last 10 logs.<br>
