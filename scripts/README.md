## thumbs.js

Thumbnails will not be automatically generated for files that were uploaded before enabling thumbnails generation in the config file.

To generate thumbnails for those files, you can use `yarn thumbs`.

```none
$ yarn thumbs
$ node ./scripts/thumbs.js
Generate thumbnails.

Usage:
node scripts/thumbs.js <mode=1|2|3> [force=0|1] [verbose=0|1] [cfcache=0|1]

mode    : 1 = images only, 2 = videos only, 3 = both images and videos
force   : 0 = no force (default), 1 = overwrite existing thumbnails
verbose : 0 = only print missing thumbs (default), 1 = print all, 2 = print nothing
cfcache : 0 = do not clear cloudflare cache (default), 1 = clear cloudflare cache
```

For example, if you only want to generate thumbnails for image files without overwriting existing ones, you can run `yarn thumbs 1`, or if you want to generate thumbnails for both image and video files, while also overwriting existsing ones, you can run `yarn thumbs 3 1`.

You will also need to use this script to overwrite existing thumbnails if you want to change thumbnail size.
